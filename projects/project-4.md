summary: We designed an application to solve a problem in the University of Hawaii at Manoa community. We created the application "What's Happening", that acts as a central hub for events goers and event organizers to consolidate and organize the various events that are going on around the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Users have the ability to make accounts and browse events, add events, and edit their own events.
