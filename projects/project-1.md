summary: Our goal is to support efforts in creating new technologies, techniques and products related to sustainability or renewable energy. We are primarily a student-led lab that strives to achieve this by promoting teamwork, communication, and lifelong learning. We were instructed to design a low-cost, accurate, and reliable Arduino-based device to collect meteorological data across the University of Hawaii at Manoa for renewable energy planning and taking step towards the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative.
