# Overall#
The problem: There isn't a consolidated place where all events on campus can be posted and viewed easily. Event postings are scattered across different media.

The solution: "What's Happening" is an application where students can both post and view events that are scheduled or happening on campus.

To use "What's Happening", students and faculty need to login using their UH ID. They can then create events, view the number of people interested going, and view the events themselves. Users can create a schedule after selecting events they are interested in and view it in calendar form on their user page. Users would be responsible for managing their own events.

# Mockup page ideas#
- Landing page
- Home page
- User page
- Event page
- Create events

# Use case ideas#
- New user goes to landing page, prompt the user to login, new user sets up profile, gets home page.
- Users go to landing page, logs in, views or creates events.
- Users can view calendar with their interested events or delete their interested events.

# Beyond the basics#
- Event reviews to rate and give feedback on how the event went.
- Creator of the event and comment updates, add details to the event description.
- For currently on-going events, users can view a timeline of whats currently happening.
