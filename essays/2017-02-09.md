## There is more than one way to skin a cat##

Engineering could be thought of as an art. Software Engineering is no different. The choices in which to place a bracket here or what to name your variables follow a specific set of rules. However, there is also an artistic freedom that comes along with it. As a software developer learns and matures, a distinct style begins to emerge, almost like a signature. Personally, I feel like ESLint restricts this styling and preferencing. I feel like it conforms a programmer to "be like everyone else". 

Why should you restrict a person from accomplishing a goal a different way if it works just the same. Sure, there are more efficient ways to do it, however; with minute details, practically, it makes no difference, just stylistically. It seems restrictive to force an engineer who is creative by nature into a cookie cutter way of programming.

## It's not all bad##

I do agree however, that coding standards do help to teach a language. By teaching the "proper" way to do things, one can get creative and develop their own coding style. It allows for easy comparison and easy review of code and more often than not, leaves a very cookbook way of coding.

I personally feel like getting the green checkmark is a painful thing, especially under time contraints. Given that we have a set amount of time, I feel like if it works, it should suffice. Given an extended period of time, I feel like ESLint is good to make sure that the code is uniform, professional, and concise. However, in the situation of the WODs, I disagree with having to get the green checkmark.
