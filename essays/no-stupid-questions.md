## There really are stupid questions.##

We as human beings have the ability to communicate in a whole variety of ways. We have cell phones, text messages, radio signals and of course our own voices. However, it doesn't matter how sophisticated the technology if the users communicate ineffectively. 

The person who asks the question clearly has a need for information. However, if his need is unclear, then of course the answers he/she recieves will also be unclear. As a result, the person who asked the question is unhappy, and the time of the person who asked the question was wasted.

With the dawn of the information age with internet and other resources, there is information readily available at many's finger tips. Of course in order for the information to be on the internet in the first place, the question had to be asked originally. However, if the question has been answered before, and a simple google search would yield the answer, why waste someone else's time answering a question that already has been answered.

## Why it is so important to ask good questions. Please.##

It is in the best interest of both parties to ask and answer good questions. When you ask good questions you give yourself an opportunity for good answers. Specifically for software engineers, questions are often complex and the answers just as complex.

Clarity is one of the most important keys to successful questions and answers. If it is clear what you want, it will be clear and simple to answer. Also, showing one's own attempts at a solution and research towards the question is important and also ties into the clarity of the question. If the people who answer the questions can see what you already tried, they can get a better idea of what you don't understand.

It is important to ask the right people. If you ask a questions that is completely irrelevant to them, it becomes a stupid question to them. Therefore knowing who you are asking is an important factor in asking a good question.

## You don't have to do it alone.##

I really don't want to discourage anyone from asking questions. Questions are the way that people learn and discover new things. However, there are certainly dumb questions that communicate poorly or waste time. Time and effort that could be used to create new ideas, ask better questions, and communicate effectively.

As a result, my final stance on this is that questions are necessary and even welcome up to a point. If sufficient effort and understanding is shown and what is being questioned is clear, that question deserves to be answered. I certainly would not be where I am today without asking questions, however, no one is perfect, and a stupid one comes out every so often. It happens.
